# DataScienceProject
Project of Me and my fellow Ilya.
The initial file that we took was the time series data of the "beer" search requests in Yandex per year, as can be seen from the picture, the data has an obvious seasonal effect.

Speaking of source of data, the time series file was taken from the site Yandex Wordstat(here's the link: [a link](https://wordstat.yandex.ru/?region=all&view=graph&words=%D0%9F%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE)). 
The data - number of requests of the word "Пиво" per month, starting at January 2018 up to November 2024.
